### Weather Forecast API

# ⚙️ Implementation and Architecture

The project uses a modular NestJS architecture.
Modules Overview:

1. # weather/ – Weather Module

weather.service.ts: Handles fetching and processing weather data via Axios.

weather.controller.ts: Exposes REST API endpoints (GET /weather?city={city}).

interfaces/: Type definitions for external API responses.

dto/: Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for validating requests.

2. # subscription/ – Subscription Module

subscription.service.ts: Manages CRUD operations for email subscriptions.

subscription.controller.ts: API endpoints to manage subscriptions:

POST /subscription: subscribe

DELETE /subscription/:email: unsubscribe

entities/: TypeORM entities defining database schema.

dto/: DTOs for input validation.

3. # email/ – Email Module

email.service.ts: Sends emails using Nodemailer.

SMTP credentials are securely managed through .env configuration.

4. # scheduler/ – Scheduler Module

scheduler.service.ts: Utilizes @nestjs/schedule to automate daily email dispatches (e.g., via cron jobs).

# 🗄️ Database

PostgreSQL database integrated via TypeORM.

Database configuration is managed in src/database/typeorm-config.ts.

Migrations stored in src/database/migrations/.

# Docker Setup

The application uses Docker for consistency across development and deployment environments:

# Start Docker containers
docker-compose up --build

# Run database migrations
docker exec -it weather-forecast-api npm run migration:run

🧪 Testing

Testing is done using Jest, with both unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests:

# Run unit tests
npm run test

# Run end-to-end tests
npm run test:e2e

# 🔧 Useful NPM Scripts

npm run start:dev       # Start server in development mode with hot-reload
npm run migration:run   # Execute database migrations
npm run test            # Execute unit tests
npm run test:e2e        # Execute end-to-end tests

# 🚀 Deployment Options

# Development Deployment

Docker-compose is used for quick setup and local testing.

Continuous hot-reload for fast development.

Run migrations easily within the Docker environment.

# Production Deployment

Deploy using Docker containers on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, DigitalOcean).

Ensure .env variables are securely managed in production environments.

Configure proper networking and security groups for database access.
